          Once when I was still in school I was assigned a 3 week group project building a program in MATLAB.  All the students were assigned to pairs and initially everything seemed to be working between my partner and I.  We finished the assignment after 2 weeks in the computer lab and showed our working code to the professor.  He thought it was good and would receive a good grade.

          Unfortunately, a 'good grade' wasn't good enough for my partner.  The night before the assignment was due he unilaterally, and without telling me, decided to improve the code by adding more functionality.  While trying to do this, he modified the core of the program in a number of ways which broke it.  He had directly overwritten the old code and there was no easy way to revert.  Two hours before the assignment was due I received a panicked phone call from my partner telling me he had broken our project, there was no backup, and would I please come to the computer lab to help him fix it.

          I rushed over to the computer lab and asked him why he had done this without asking me.  He said he thought it would be an easy change and didn't want to bother me.  I read over the remaining code and it was a mess.  We were so time pressured and I was so angry that I spent the remaining time sitting beside him and coding in silence.  We turned the project in an hour late but the professor was very understanding, although surprised that it wasn't as good as the work we had shown him a week earlier.

          Two days later my partner and I met up again.  The situation still stung but we had a good conversation about what had happened.  I told him how angry and hurt I had been about him changing the code without asking me.  I also apologized for refusing to talk to him for 2 hours while we worked side by side.  He reiterated that he was sorry and was only trying to get us a better grade.  He also said he had learned not to do it again.  It was good to talk about the situation and I actually think not saying anything in the heat of the moment, while socially awkward, did prevent a potentially pointless and destructive conversation from happening.  My partner and I are still friends and have even gotten to the point where we can joke about what has come to be known as "the MATLAB incident".
