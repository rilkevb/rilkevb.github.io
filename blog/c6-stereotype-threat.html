          According to Google a stereotype is "a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing."  (1)  It is necessary to simplify and abstract in order to get through the day.  We rely on this to manage an otherwise overwhelming amount of data and choices but stereotypes quickly become very destructive when applied to humans.

          <br> <br>
          Humans are dynamic individuals with different histories, backgrounds temperaments, and beliefs.  Everyone is unique and changing moment to moment.  Stereotyping a group of humans -- developing and using an oversimplified image of them -- immediately restricts our knowledge of each other and begins to dehumanize the people it is applied to.


          <br><br>
          Realizing this basic fact and becoming more aware of the stereotypes present throughout our society is a good first step towards combating stereotypes, but more is needed.  To develop a society with less harmful stereotypes requires people to speak out when they see them used.  It requires people to actively engage with people they view as different than themselves so as to break down the oversimplified images in their minds.  And it requires individuals to strive to see what is unique in other people rather than view them as a collection of simplistic ideas.
