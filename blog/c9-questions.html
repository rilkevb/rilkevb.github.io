          Asking questions is always a crucial part of my learning process and I try to do it well.  Towards that end, I try to remember the following points when crafting questions and interacting with people who are trying to answer my questions:

          <br> <br>
           1.)  State the question clearly.  I type it out, pause for a moment, and then reread it.  Could someone else instantly understand what I am asking?  Is it grammatically correct?  Is the spelling correct?  Do I supply enough context for the question to make sense?

          <br><br>
          2.)  Regarding supplying enough context, I try to be extremely aware of the mutual information shared by myself and the person who is answering my question.  With a good friend asking "Are we up?" is enough of a question for him to tell me the current score of the game we are both interested in.  This is because we have a largely overlapping field of interest and a lot of mutual information.  But posing this same question to a different person with less shared knowledge and perspective will only illicit a puzzled look.  To avoid this, it is necessary to take into account the perspective of the person and supply sufficient context so they can understand the question easily.
          <br><br>
          3.)  State what you are trying to accomplish in the end.  When asking a question about how to accomplish something, particularly a question about programming, I always try to state what I am attempting to accomplish.  If I have a problem making a given method work it is often the case that I am approaching the larger problem in an inefficient or impossible way.  By stating my final aim, it allows more knowledgeable people to recommend local improvements but also better global approaches.
         <br><br>
          4.)  Remember to be appreciative and polite.  The people answering my questions are doing me a big favor and I want to show them the respect this favor merits.
