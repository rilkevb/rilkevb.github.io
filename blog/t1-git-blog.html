          Version control systems (VCS) are software tools which aid in the development of other software projects.  Specifically, they exist to track and organize the changes which happen in the source code while a project is being built.  Different VCS have different features but all aim to increase developer productivity and quality by logging who, does what, when.  By doing this, the VCS makes it easier to see the current state of the project, different developers contributions, and aids collaboration.
          <br><br>
          Git is one of the most popular VCS.  Originally developed to aid the creation of the Linux operating system it works by taking and recording snapshots of a project’s file tree.  When a user changes a sub file of the project they commit it to git, and git saves an instance of it.  To run the software project, git collects the most current instance of each subfile and uses them to create the entire project.  In this way, it is constantly collecting the new changes into the project.  Equally important, git saves each of the earlier instances of the sub files.  Should a bug arise in a new version of a sub file, the user only has to revert to the previous version of the sub file saved in git.

          Git is amazing but on its own it only exists on a user’s local machine.  To collaborate with other programmers on the internet git is combined with GitHub.  GitHub stores a project on a central server so many different users can access it.  It also supplies version control tools to augment git’s.  In this way programmers in different locals can collaborate on a single software project stored on GitHub.
