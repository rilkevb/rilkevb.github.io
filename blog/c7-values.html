          DBC asked us to think about and reflect on a few questions about our personal values.  My answers are the following:
          <br> <br>

 1.)  When I reflect back to times in my life when I have been the happiest and the most satisfied many of these instances embodied a few of the same values.  In no particular order, these values are awareness, integrity, curiosity, understanding, play, love, kindness, and calm.

          <br><br>
          2.)  Although, it is not explicitly stated on the list of values, I think awareness is one of the most important values for me.  Awareness is being aware of who I am.  This includes my thoughts, my emotions, my belief framework, and how these are interacting.  It also includes being aware of where I am.  This includes how the environment and the people I am spending my time with are affecting and being affected by me.  I see awareness as being awake to life and truth.  Without it, it is very easy to descend into self-delusion and distraction which will waste the precious years I have left.  I know I will never be fully aware (what would this even mean?) but I see it as something I should aspire towards.
   <br><br>
 3.)  I try to live up to these values as much as I can but there is always room for improvement.
    <br><br>
4.)  The last topic someone asked me for advice on was how to be more effective when studying Ruby and Javascript.
   <br><br>
5.)  When I think about my values it serves to clarify what is important to me but also show how much further I need to go.  Also, when confronting challenging situations I know that reflecting on my values helps me focus on what I want and power through the difficult times.
