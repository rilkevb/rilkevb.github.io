          DBC is very interested in teaching and practicing pair programming.  They encourage a driver/navigator model where one student is the driver and the other works as the navigator.  The navigator is supposed to dictate the overall structure of the code and keep track of global issues.  The driver types, implements the navigator's overall scheme, and keeps track of syntax and local code issues such as variable names.
          <br> <br>
          Thus far, almost all of my different pairing sessions at DBC have been good in one way or another.  My partners have been skilled communicators and very courteous.  Everyone has been very quick to share suggestions, think about new ideas, and have worked diligently on the assigned problem.  I've really enjoyed getting to know my fellow boots and look forward to meeting them in person.
          <br><br>
          After every pairing session DBC requires us to give detailed written feedback for our partner which they can then read.  This takes a little time but I think it is worth it.  I have appreciated people's suggestions ("Pay more attention to who is driving and who is navigating") and think their comments will help me become a better programmer.
          <br><br>
          Seeing the amount of effort some people put into their feedback encourages me to make mine better and more helpful.  I try to focus on the positive and offer what suggestions I can.  At the same time, I make a lot of effort not to comment on issues where I don't have any expertise.  Feedback needs to be kind, actionable, and specific but if it is not also coming from an informed perspective then I think it can do more damage than good.
          <br><br>
          Overall, I think pairing/feedback is a very useful tool (among many) to guide my learning and look forward to doing more of it in the future.
