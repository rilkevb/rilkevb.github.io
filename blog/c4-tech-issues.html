          'Monopoly' is defined as:
          <br><br>
"a situation in which a single company or group owns all or nearly all of the market for a given type of product or service." (1)
<br><br>
Historically, business monopolies used their control of the market to raise prices, stymie innovation, and sell inferior products.  All of these actions injured consumers and business monopolies were disdained and condemned.
<br><br>
But they persisted.  It didn't matter that the monopolies were hated by the public because there were many other factors perpetuating their existence.  Gigantic economies of scale meant that once a business controlled the majority of the market they could undercut the price of their competitors and drive them out of business.  At this point, it would usually be infeasible for new competitors to enter because the start-up costs relative to the payback period would be too high.  If a competitor was able to get started the monopoly business would either buy them out or drive them out of business by flooding the local market with cheap competing products.  Beyond these tactics, monopolies were also famous for their bribing of regulators and representatives in order to keep the the legislative and judicial environments under their control.
<br><br>
By 1900 many crucial U.S. industries were controlled by monopolies.  Oil, steel, copper, sugar, tobacco, meatpacking, and railroads were just some of the monopolized industries.  It is a long story, but around this time the U.S. federal government began passing laws and regulations against monopolies and began forcefully regulating and breaking them up.(2)  Over the next 100 years the number of major monopolies acting in the U.S. economy plummeted and consumers reaped the benefits.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, during the last 15 years we have seen the re-emergence of many full or quasi business monopolies in the U.S.  These companies are concentrated in internet technology where network effects and giant war-chests of venture capital money has allowed them to capture very high percentages of their markets.  Google controls 67.5% of the U.S. search market.(3)  Amazon controls 64% of total online printed book sales and 67% of total online e-book sales. (4)  Apple controls around 70% of online music sales. (5)  Facebook is really the only viable general social network.  LinkedIn is the dominant professional network.
<br><br>
Each of these business has denied, and will continue to deny, that they have monopoly shares of their markets but that is not true; U.S. consumers and related businesses should be very wary of the power they wield.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has opened examinations of many of dominant internet companies. I hope the FTC continues to be vigilant.  Perhaps, the monopoly market share of these businesses will fade away in the hyper competitive environment of the internet economy.  That said, many of them (such as Google) have been remarkably persistent and in the future society might need to consider more creative methods of regulation and control to check the potentially stifling power of these businesses.
