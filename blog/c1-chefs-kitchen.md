My Current Take on the DBC Experience.

After the first week of Phase 0 and Shereef’s video I believe that DBC will be an extremely intense but rewarding experience defined, primarily, by the amount of effort I’m willing to put into it.  I think it is a place where people are united by a desire to work as hard as they can to develop the skills necessary to be able to start creating.  I’m excited.  I want to work with a group of people who operate in an ownership creator mode.  I want to see how much and how fast I can learn.  I want to contribute to this type of community.  Of course I’m nervous, but that sensation is completely overwhelmed by my desire to get started.
