          Ruby is an object oriented programming(OOP) language and because of this it is dominated by classes.  Classes are extensible templates used to create other code objects.  A class can store basic information (attributes) and ways of doing things (methods).  A general class is used to create specific objects (also called "instances of the class").  A class is like an apple pie recipe.  It contains lists of ingredients (attributes) and instructions for what to do (methods).  If you take this recipe and make a particular apple pie then that specific apple pie is like an object or an "instance of the class".
          <br><br>
          Classes are a natural choice for organizing programs(1) when the programmer wants to group specific data and functions into one unit.  If you are modelling a physical object it makes sense to put all its attributes and the actions it can perform into one class.  Or, if you are building a collection of tools to analyze or present an abstract problem it can make sense to group all of them into one class.
          <br><br>
          An example of using classes in this second manner is this class which I wrote:  (Please pardon the formatting; I'll make it easier to read later.)

          The code is a little long but basically it allows a person to see and play around with the Collatz Conjecture and resulting Hailstone Sequences.
          <br><br>
          In case you are wondering what the Collatz Conjecture is, all you need to do is create a new object (pass it any positive integer you want) and call the explanation method.
          <br><br>
          <span id="ruby">
            attempt1 = Collatz_Conjecture.new(17)<br>
            p attempt1.explanation<br>
          </span>
          <br><br>
          This returns:   <br><br>
          <span id="ruby">The Collatz_Conjecture is named after the mathematician Lothar Collatz who proposed it in 1937.
          It is a mathematical conjecture which states:<br><br>

          Take any natural number X.  If X is even, divide it by 2.  If X is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.<br>
          Repeat this process indefinitely.  The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with,<br>
          you will always eventually reach 1.  (wikipedia)<br><br>

          The sequence of numbers produced by executing the above algorithm is often called a 'hailstone sequence'<br>
          because the numbers go up and down erratically like hail in a thundercloud.<br>
          </span>
          <br><br>
          If you want to see the numeric sequence resulting from the initialization value you passed, just type:
          <br><br>
          <span id="ruby">p attempt1.print_numeric_sequence </span> <br> <br>
          For this example, using 17 as the initial value, it returns: <br> <br>
          <span id="ruby">[17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]  </span> <br> <br>
          If you want a more graphical representation of the sequence you can type: <br> <br>
          <span id="ruby">attempt1.print_graph_approximation </span> <br> <br>
          And it will print a series of labelled bars to the console to help better visualize the sequence: <br> <br>
          <span id="ruby">-----------------  17 <br>
          ----------------------------------------------------  52 <br>
          --------------------------  26 <br>
          -------------  13 <br>
          ----------------------------------------  40 <br>
          --------------------  20 <br>
          ----------  10 <br>
          -----  5 <br>
          ----------------  16 <br>
          --------  8 <br>
          ----  4 <br>
          --  2 <br>
          -  1 <br>
           </span>
           <br> <br>
          If you are wondering about the proof for this wonderful bit of mathematics you can even request to see it with: <br> <br>
          <span id="ruby">puts attempt1.proof </span>
          <br> <br>
          However, this method doesn't return the most satisfying answer.

        1.  Classes/Objects are one way to structure programs.  Although Ruby is an OOP I generally think structuring programs in a functional manner is easier to read, easier to program, directly helps manage program complexity, and lends itself more easily to multi-threading and concurrent execution. <br>
