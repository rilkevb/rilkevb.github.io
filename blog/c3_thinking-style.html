      <h2> Thinking About Learning at DBC </h2>

          DBC requires new students to take a quiz identifying their "Gregorc Thinking Style". (1)  This 'model', using two bits of information (2), divides all learners into 4 different thinking categories.  After taking the quiz I was basically tied between 3 different categories: 'Concrete Sequential', 'Concrete Random', and 'Abstract Sequential'.  The supplied interpretation guide tells you what these different categories mean.  Among many other things, I discovered that I like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> "applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems" </li>
            <li> "experimenting to find answers" </li>
            <li>"analyzing situations before making a decision or acting". </li>
            <li> "using my intuition"(3) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Pairing these insights with my own observations about how I learn has helped me optimize my learning in the first 3 weeks of Phase 0.

          Of course, there is still a great deal of room for improvement.  Effectively managing my time and organizing what I'm learning are areas where I want to improve.  Using a modified 'pomodoro technique' has really helped me structure my time and remember to take regular breaks. I want to continue using it daily.  Also, while I inefrequently wrote and almost never reviewed class notes before DBC, I've found that methodically typing out each new HTML/CSS/Ruby element and then reading over these notes at the end of the day has really helped me internalize all this new information.
          <br><br>
          I want to keep looking for ways to broaden and improve my ability to learn.  For this coming week, I want to work on taking a minute or two to think about programming problems in the abstract before immediatly diving into the code.  I hope this will encourage me to think about the big picture and arrive at more elegant, interdependent solutions.

        1.  A 'model' for 'how people learn' presented as empirical fact although, like most 'learning models', there appears to be almost no supporting research/studies to explain the validity of the proposed divisions and it is debatable if a falsifiable hypothesis could even be presented within the framework.
        <br><br>
        2.  I'm not sure if this is enough information to describe the diversity how humans approach the world in any meaningful way.
        <br><br>
        3.  Which requires an incredibly charitable interpretation to not appear as completely conflicting statements.
