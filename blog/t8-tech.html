          Big O notation is generally used to describe the upper bound on a functions growth.  In this way, it is a view on the limiting behavior of a function as the function heads towards a very large but finite value.

          But why is this so important in computer science?  Excellent question.  Computers can only perform a limited number of calculations per second and their memory can only store a limited amount of data.  Although these speed and memory limits are constantly increasing it is still very important to know how much of these resources a given program will consume.  Big O notation gives us a way to talk about the worst case usage scenario for different functions.  We can take many different functions for performing the same operation and classify them based on whether they will run in O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(2^N), O(log N), etc..  After we have performed this classification we can then choose the best function/program for our particular situation.
