      <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
      <p>Working with someone else to increase the quality of code output.
      It allows you to have two sets of eyes on one project, one person can focus on the syntax,
      and the other can focus on the global picture. At the same time both can be checking the other
        persons work.

      <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
      <p>It is diffficult for a master to explain what they can easily do.  People
          learning together can more easily sympathize with the other's situation and
          therefore can often articulate a problem more clearly.

      <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
      <p>A driver is the one typing and focusing on the syntax.  The navigator primarily
      focuses on the overall picture in mind.

      <h3>Reflect:</h3>
      <p>It was enjoyable pairing for the first time. The communication worked
        really well, as did stypi. Wish there was a spell check and that I could type faster.
        (something I have been using to help is 'gtypist', It's a command line tool that
        teaches you how to imporove your typing skills!
